I am a member of the George Washington University’s Class of 2018, earning a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. 

I am most interested in the intersection between technology and design, and am eager to learn more about the digital strategy industry through hands on experience. Upon leveraging my experience and skills, I am seeking to build my network of professionals within Marketing, Advertising, and UX/UI Web Design. 

 
## Current Interests and Projects:

* GW Alternative Breaks - Las Marias, PR
* GW Women in Business - Spring Conference Marketing Committee
* Capitol Advertising – AFF National Student Advertising Competition
